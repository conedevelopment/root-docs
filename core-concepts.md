## What is Root?

Root is an admin package for Laravel applications. It offers a simple model management with a robust resource API and a modern and fast UI.

## Scope and Scale

Root is a quite simple, drop-in admin package. It means, it requires less configuration when installing, so probably it's easier to migrate between versions, or migrate between projects.

However, it comes with a price: Root is scoped to small, medium-sized projects: e-commerce or generic CMS projects.

## Comparing to other packages, solutions

Root is targeting smaller applications and offers simpler and faster integration into your running or fresh application.
