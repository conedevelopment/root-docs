# What is Root?

Root is an admin package for Laravel applications. It offers a simple model management with a robust resource API and a modern and fast UI.

# Scope and Scale

## Comparing to other packages/solutions

Root is heavily inspired by [Symfony EasyAdmin](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/index.html) and [Lavel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/).

> Please note, we do not hold a Laravel Nova license and never seen its source code. Any code we've seen regarding to Nova is in its docs or publicly availavble video courses.

Root is targeting smaller applications and offers simpler and faster integration into your running or fresh application. But for very large applications you may consider using Nova. Nova has a big community and first-party support since it's maintained by the Laravel team. Also, it has some features (Vapor and Scout support for example) that we don't and probalby won't support in the future.
